# misc-computers
Misc microcomputer projects Iâ€™ve built. More info @ https://tholin.dev/misc_comps

Contains hardware schematics and PCB design files (if applicable) for each computer, as well as example software.

I hope this repo will help people with building their own computers. You can either re-build one of the systems from here, or reference my code and schematics when designing your own.
